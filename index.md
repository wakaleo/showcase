## [String Calculator](https://github.com/wakaleo/portfolio-string-calculator)

The String Calculator is a simple Java coding exercise that introduced me to the concepts and practice of TDD and the red-green-refactor cycles. The goal of the kata is to create a function that turns simple mathematical expressions into numerical results. Some of the techniques I learned doing this exercise included String manipulation, Lambda expressions and streams, and String formatting in Java.
